      <h2>Who you think you are talking to</h2>
      <img  src="http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/13/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-16348-1412703198-9.jpg" width="375px" height="667px">
      <h2>Who you are actually talking to</h2>
      
      <p>Problem: </p>
      <p>Tinder has been abused by many users, which downgrade the effectiveness of match making in its platform. To maximize the possibility of matching with girls/guys, it’s one’s best interest to always swipe right, which “likes” every single one you see without knowing them. </p>
      <p>Core Solution:</p>
      <p>Based on Tinder model: when first started, one user would be given a certain amount of free roses (eg. 99). When you swipe right to like someone. It means you will spend one rose. One can swipe right till he spends all the roses. Then:</p>
      <p>a. He/she can wait a day, and get small amount of free roses (eg. 1).</p>
      <p>b. Or he/she can choose to purchase roses with dollars.</p>
      <p>This solution imply opportunity cost for the user which encourage them to make choices more carefully, thus result in a better effectiveness. </p>
      
      <h1><!-- Solution -->ROSS</h1>
      
      <h2>First Version of our APP</h2>
      <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2dawWucFfzo/VSb9dCPrCpI/AAAAAAAAAn4/pn6Lo07ISHs/w300-h522-no/friends-tinder-profiles-ross.jpg" alt="" width="375px" height="667px"/>
      <h2>Second Version of our APP</h2>
      <img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JLy58H_t4V8/VScEoIGrcSI/AAAAAAAAAoY/8VcoWUKMqYE/w299-h522-no/anigif_enhanced-12679-1428475831-17.gif" alt="" width="375px" height="667px"/>
      
      <h2>Additional Features</h2>
        <p>2.	User will be notified if he/she matches with someone. Then you will enter the Matches interface. Here, you will see all the matches you have made. </p>
        <p>3.	Users’ profile is imported from Facebook. And user needs to edit their interest base on modules. The core feature of this app is to learn what the user actually like, to find the perfect matches. One user can choose tags that fit them the best, and changes them depends on their personal status. This tags will become the key words to find their best matches later. </p>
        <p> 4.	Now, after the system “know” enough about the user, it can start to pull up a list of better matches: </p>
        <p>a.	This is based on location, education, interests, and ages </p>
        <p>b.	OTHER algorithms that would help </p>
        <p> 5.	Then, user can start conversion with the perfect match:</p>
        <p> a.	User enters the best match interface, and the profile of the best match would appear (ONLY). </p>
        <p>b.	Both parties can strike a conversation, hopefully, you two would exchange number/Facebook/or other social network. (Alternately, friend each other on ROSS) </p>
        <p>c.	If the conversation does not go well, one party can choose to pause the conversation. 
          i.	if the other party choose pause, then both parties can move on to the next best math.
          ii.	if the other party want to continue: he has a chance to send one message with the expense of 2 roses.(messages should be limited to certain amount) </p>
        <p>d.	The one who pause can choose to continue, or force quit.
          e.	Then both parties move on to the next perfect match. </p>
