					<p>My name is Tim Meng. I am the founder of Tim’s Meatballs.<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-23HsEyy_V9Q/VSb9dHnC0FI/AAAAAAAAAn0/6Knkul7yTHE/w305-h541-no/justinasjustin.jpg" alt=""  width=“50px” height=“100px"/> I study Economics in UCLA, and I am originally from China. I love food and I have growth up in a foodie family. While I cannot stop eating meat, I want to share my love of meatball to everyone. So I created Tim’s meatballs to bring all kinds of meatballs from around the world.</p>
